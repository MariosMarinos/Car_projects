# MariosMarinos-Questionaree_cars

1. Run the create_car_DB file to initialize the cars, users and reviews databases (change the path of pickle file accordingly), be aware that the images should be inside the server static/images/ folder in order for this to work. (Zip with all the images can be found on: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nW_qopvNPOqbRopM994-jWN-U7MtMlsi?usp=sharing), Also the databases should be mySQL.
2. Change the db.yaml file accordingly to match the new server (since now it is running on my local host). 
3. Get in the folder and run my_serv.py (python3 my_serv.py) to start the server.

## TODO:
1. Display 10 cars instead and not just 1.
2. Assure that all the files are filled in the User statistics form, otherwise it might crash.
